<br>
Simple transmitter &amp; receiver code for use with RPi and an optical communication device.
<br><br>
The code was made in order to modulate a laser-pointer and optical receiver through the use of a Raspberry Pi, and thus transmitting and receiving digital data. Transmission is made through on-off keying the laser.

In all fairness, this code should only be seen as a working prototype, and not a fully operational system.
